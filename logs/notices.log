May 31 00:03:10.000 [notice] Tor 0.4.5.16 opening new log file.
May 31 00:03:10.947 [notice] We compiled with OpenSSL 101010ef: OpenSSL 1.1.1n  15 Mar 2022 and we are running with OpenSSL 1010117f: 1.1.1w. These two versions should be binary compatible.
May 31 00:03:10.947 [notice] Tor 0.4.5.16 running on Linux with Libevent 2.1.12-stable, OpenSSL 1.1.1w, Zlib 1.2.11, Liblzma 5.2.5, Libzstd 1.4.8 and Glibc 2.31 as libc.

May 31 00:03:10.947 [notice] Read configuration file "/etc/tor/torrc".
May 31 00:03:10.948 [notice] Based on detected system memory, MaxMemInQueues is set to 8192 MB. You can override this by setting MaxMemInQueues by hand.
May 31 00:03:10.948 [warn] CookieAuthFileGroupReadable is set, but will have no effect: you must specify an explicit CookieAuthFile to have it group-readable.

May 31 00:03:10.000 [warn] Your log may contain sensitive information - you're logging more than "notice". Don't log unless it serves an important reason. Overwrite the log afterwards.
May 31 00:03:10.000 [notice] You are running a new relay. Thanks for helping the Tor network! If you wish to know what will happen in the upcoming weeks regarding its usage, have a look at https://blog.torproject.org/lifecycle-of-a-new-relay
May 31 00:03:10.000 [notice] It looks like I need to generate and sign a new medium-term signing key, because I don't have one. To do that, I need to load (or create) the permanent master identity key. If the master identity key was not moved or encrypted with a passphrase, this will be done automatically and no further action is required. Otherwise, provide the necessary data using 'tor --keygen' to do it manually.
May 31 00:03:11.000 [notice] Your Tor server's identity key  fingerprint is 'relaycoldav 83C27676E111C9623CFB772B93105326D88FE2F9'

May 31 00:05:15.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We have no usable consensus.

May 31 00:05:15.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We have no usable consensus.
May 31 00:05:15.000 [notice] The current consensus has no exit nodes. Tor can only build internal paths, such as paths to onion services.

May 31 00:05:15.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/8626, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 0% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
May 31 00:05:16.000 [notice] We'd like to launch a circuit to handle a connection, but we already have 32 general-purpose client circuits pending. Waiting until some finish.
May 31 00:05:16.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 50% (loading_descriptors): Loading relay descriptors
May 31 00:05:17.000 [notice] The current consensus contains exit nodes. Tor can build exit and internal paths.
